            <p>Dear diary, today I got absolutely roasted.</p>

            <p>I was talking to my mentor, and somewhere between chatting about projects and motivation, he said, <em>“You’ve got that executive dysfunction type of ADHD. 
                You plan, plan, plan… but can’t put things into action.”</em>
            </p>

            <p>I just sat there like, wow, okay. Straight to the jugular. He wasn’t wrong though. I’ve got entire Notion pages, diagrams, app icons, folder structures, and
                color palettes for ideas that never even made it past the concept stage. I plan every pixel and workflow like Bill Gates is wearing a Jigsaw mask, and the 
                challenge is to present a completely bugless app or lose a leg. At this point, I was already halfway through shopping for a prosthetic. Nothing ever makes 
                it to the finish line because I get caught in this endless loop of “planning to start.” Even writing these posts takes me forever, since I keep rewriting the 
                first paragraph like it’s being graded by the internet.</p>

            <p>It’s not laziness, it’s fear disguised as preparation. My brain convinces me I can’t start until I’ve figured everything out. It tells me I need the perfect 
                plan before I’ve earned the right to begin. That’s how I end up with twenty half-planned masterpieces and zero shipped apps.</p>

            <p>When I started <strong>Silks</strong>, every tiny detail was mapped out, because I thought the more I planned, the smoother things would go. 
                Spoiler alert, it doesn't work that way. Planning didn’t stop things from changing; 
                it just delayed the part where I actually learned by doing.</p>

            <p>I’m not against planning. You’d have to pry my Notion board from my cold, over-organised hands. It keeps me sane, and it’s the only reason
                I can scale projects without losing my mind halfway through. Still, there’s a fine balance. There’s the kind of planning that helps you 
                build properly, and then there’s the kind that quietly becomes a shield, something to hide behind because you’re scared the thing in 
                your head might not be as perfect in real life.</p>

            <p>That’s where I live most of the time. I tell myself, <em>“I’m just organising my thoughts,”</em> when really I’m building a fortress
                of perfectly formatted bullet points to protect myself from failure. If it’s not built yet, it can’t be bad yet, right? Eventually, 
                though, you have to face it. Your first version will never look like the shiny image in your mind, and that’s fine. That’s where the fun begins.</p>

            <p>When I started working on <strong>Spicy Fusion Kitchen</strong>, the recipe app I’m building for my sister’s food blog, I decided to do things 
                differently. I didn’t obsess over folder names, icons, bits and bobs. I just built it. The whole point is to learn through doing,
                not to create a flawless blueprint that falls apart the second I touch real code.</p>

            <p>Surprisingly, it’s been so much more fun this way. I forgot how satisfying it feels to create something when you’re not suffocating
                under your own expectations. Each small piece I finish, even if it’s a little rough around the edges, feels like progress instead of pressure.</p>

                <img src="../images/memes/20.10.25.png" alt="Just make it exist first quote"
                     style="width:20%; max-width:400px; border-radius:14px; display:inline-block;">
            </figure>


            <p>Perfectionism has killed my momentum, time and time again. Sometimes I have to let things be messy, even ugly, before they can become something beautiful.
                The first version doesn’t have to impress anyone, it just needs to exist.</p>

            <p>He wasn’t wrong, and that stung a little, but I think that’s how growth works. Someone points out the thing you’ve been quietly ignoring, and suddenly it clicks.
                I’d rather move forward imperfectly than keep waiting for the “right” moment that never shows up.</p>
